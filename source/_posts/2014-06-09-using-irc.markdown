As part of our project we are using IRC, (Internet Relay Chat). IRC is an instant messaging system that has
a Spree channel, where people working on the Spree open source project can go and talk to each other.

To use IRC you can download a desktop application or you can go to [Freenode](webchat.freenode.net), our username
is spree-girls, and some of the simple commands we might use are:

* `/join spree` - to go to the Spree channel
* `/msg username message` - to message a particular user privately
* `/notice username message` - to message a particular user publicly
* `/help` - obviously for help
