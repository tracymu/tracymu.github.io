<p>As part of our project we are using IRC, (Internet Relay Chat). IRC is an instant messaging system that has a Spree channel, where people working on the Spree open source project can go and talk to each other.</p>
<p>To use IRC you can download a desktop application or you can go to <a href="webchat.freenode.net">Freenode</a>. Our username is spree-girls, and some of the simple commands we might use are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>/join spree</code> - to go to the Spree channel</li>
	<li><code>/msg username message</code> - to message a particular user privately</li>
	<li><code>/notice username message</code> - to message a particular user publicly</li>
	<li><code>/help</code> - obviously for help</li>
</ul>
